            <p>Jon Nicol wrote a post this week titled <a href="http://www.worshipteamcoach.com/blog/2014/09/02/10-ways-to-hate-your-congregation">“10 ways to hate your congregation”</a>. It’s worth a read, but I’d like to focus on a point he makes during the introduction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was more focused on set lists and segues and building a band than I was forging relationships with those I was leading. I didn’t hate them, but I sure wasn’t loving them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of planning for a service involves understanding your congregation - what they’re going through, what big events have happened, what needs to be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Acknowledgement doesn’t have to be specific, either. It can be as simple as a general theme used to shape the songs and verses you choose. Specifics can be left to the notices, or intercessory prayer.</p>

<p>When the service is relevant to the needs of the congregation, it creates room for those people to feel understood and loved, and perhaps give them a nudge to reach out for support if needed. It enables a community of understanding, support, and compassion.</p>

<p>But, how do we find out what’s going on? In the lead up to your service, here are three things you can do.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="ask-your-pastor">1) Ask your pastor</h2>

<p>Flick your pastor an email, and ask what’s been going on. A pastor has a pretty good pulse on what’s been happening in the church. Is it a time or rejoicing, or mourning, or both? Is there a big event coming up that can be integrated in to the service?</p>

<p>For bigger churches a pastor can’t know what’s going on in everyone’s life. The bigger stuff, sure. But smaller, equally important, matters might not reach their way to ‘the top’.</p>

<h2 id="ask-the-youth-pastor-and-home-group-leaders">2) Ask the youth pastor, and home group leaders</h2>

<p>Ask your youth pastor, or children’s group leaders. They’ll have a special insight into the lives of our young ones. Keeping the service relevant to them is super important in ensuring they feel part of the church.</p>

<p>Home group leaders (a.k.a. bible studies, or other groups outside of church) also have a closer relationship to specific subsets of the congregation.</p>

<p>Reaching out to your pastor, youth pastor, and home group leaders helps you understand the life of the church in a broader sense.</p>

<h2 id="talk-to-someone">3) Talk to someone!</h2>

<p>This is one I really struggle with. I’m fine up the front, but talking to people outside my peer group is a challenge.</p>

<blockquote class="hero-quote">
  <p>Have a coffee with someone, and ask how things are <strong>really</strong> going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make it a goal to talk to someone new, or build on an existing relationship, each service. Have a coffee with someone during the week, and ask how things are <em>really</em> going. Personal relationships are really important, especially during hard times. </p>

<p>As Jon’s post said, <strong>forge</strong> a relationship. Forge means the heat of the flame, and the cool of the water. Being there through the ups and downs.</p>

<p>Getting to the nitty gritty of life takes trust and time, so it’s OK to focus on those that are more relatable. But try and reach out beyond your comfort zone every now and again, to build that base of community and fellowship.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-forge-relationships">How do you forge relationships?</h2>

<p>Let me know in the comments below how you keep tabs on your congregation. How do you forge relationships? How do your services show an understanding of, and compassion for, the people in your church?</p>
