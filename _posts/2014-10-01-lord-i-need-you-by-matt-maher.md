Matt Maher's [_Lord, I Need You_](https://itunes.apple.com/), from his 2013 album [_All The People Said Amen_](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/all-the-people-said-amen-live/id634140898), describes our relationship with and dependence on the Lord, particularly when we're experiencing hardship.

## Talking points

Much of the song focuses on the attributes of God - our defender, the one who guides us, who holds us together. Because of these attributes we can trust him with a relationship of dependence, one we know will endure any and all trials thrown at us.

### 1. Peter walking on water

The bridge offers my favourite line, _"When I cannot stand I'll fall on you"_. 

This reminds me of Peter, responding to Jesus' call by walking on water in [Matthew 14 22-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014:22-33&version=NIV). When he "saw the wind" he started to sink. When the going got tough, fear and doubt crept in. Overwhelmed, he cannot stand. He cries out. _"Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him"_. In a sense he falls on Jesus, who raises him up. Christ is the sure foundation on the waters which threaten to swallow us.

Jesus then calls him "Little-Faith". Dr. Ray Pritchard puts it like this: "He was not rebuking Peter for attempting too much, but for trusting too little. If you had just kept your eyes on me, you could have walked across the ocean"[^1]

"Little faith" is something we all experience. That's why we need to remind ourselves of our dependence on Christ, and His promise to be dependable, through song. Christ is there to offer his hand when we stumble. Every hour we need him.

There's so much more you can get out of this particular story, so I think it'd be a neat topic if you want to use it as a frame for speaking around this song.

### 2. My grace is sufficient for you

Hearking back to 2004's "Your Grace Is Enough", written by Maher and recorded by Chris Tomlin, we get a mention of [2 Corinthians 12 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+12:9&version=NIV) when the Lord promises to Paul that His grace is sufficient to allow him to live with (and boast in!) his affliction.

> Where sin runs deep, your grace is more
{: .hero-quote }

Unlike Peter, where the problem was immediately solved by Jesus offering his hand, here we are reminded that hardship won't always disappear at our initial cry to Jesus. Again, we can only continue to confess our need for Jesus' love and grace, and find a way to rejoice in it!

## When to sing it

This song is quite versatile, with multiple threads you can pull out and focus on. I'd probably either do it

  * Call to worship.
    * Remind the congregation that they're not here because they have it all together, but because we are a broken people who need the love of Christ. 
    * And to affirm that Christ offers that freely!


    or

  * Before a time of reflection / sermon.
      * The song has a good mix of reflectiveness, with enough drive and joy to let their hearts sing out to God. 
      * You want the congregation to get their penitent thinking hats on, without being too mopey.

## Singability / Playability


<div class="right zoomable">
  <img src="/images/range/matt-maher-lord-i-need-you-in-b.png" alt="Musical range showing G3 to F5" class="no-margin" width="150" />
</div>

The 'original' is B. The Youtube video is in Bb. In Bb, the lowest note is a G3 - _"... I find my **rest**"_. Highest is an F5 _"Ev'**ry** hour"_.

Presuming the congregation leaves out the octave jump, doing the song up or down a couple tones might make it a bit more singable. Worship Together recommends B, G, or E.[^2]

Personally, I love the melody, especially in the chorus. It's one I can really belt out and let "me" get out of the way of worshiping, praising, and praying to God through song.There's also a great harmony line.

This song can be played super simple, with a strong acoustic guitar lead. The chords are easy, and a capo can help you get it in the right key. But there is also lots of room for a bigger band to make this really anthemic, with embellishments and support from other instruments.
