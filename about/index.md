# About Us

This blog focuses on _**et mente**_, the mind, the understanding, of worship. Why do we worship in certain ways? How we can make sure the focus stays on God? How do we enable and encourage believers & non-believers, at any stage of their walk, to grasp the meaning of what they're singing, praying, and participating in.

<blockquote class="hero-quote">
  <p>Psallam spiritu et mente</p>
</blockquote>

_"Psallam spiritu et mente"_, is the motto of the [RSCM](http://rscm.org.uk). It translates to _"I will sing with the spirit, and with the understanding also"_, and is taken from [1 Corinthians 14:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14):

> So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer, say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying? You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.

You can't put it much better than that! We'd love to get your insights in to worship too, because we certainly don't have the answers! Join us in this journey.
